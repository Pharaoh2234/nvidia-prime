nvidia-prime (0.6.2) trusty; urgency=medium

  * prime-supported:
    - Check /var/lib/ubuntu-drivers-common/requires_offloading to
      know if we need to offload rendering. There's no need to do
      hardware detection again when the gpu-manager already does
      all the work.

nvidia-prime (0.6.1) trusty; urgency=medium

  * debian/preinst.in, debian/rules:
    - Move the lightdm configuration file from /etc to /usr/share.

nvidia-prime (0.6) trusty; urgency=low

  * debian/control:
    - Breaks: ubuntu-drivers-common (<< 1:0.2.89).
  * Add support for the new ubuntu-drivers-common. The gpu-manager
    will take care of most of the work. We only need to tell
    lightdm that we want to offload rendering, and to run the
    gpu-manager on log out.

nvidia-prime (0.5.7) trusty; urgency=low

nvidia-prime (0.5.6) trusty; urgency=low

  [ Daniel Dadap ]
  * prime-xconfig:
    - Format the BusID string correctly (LP: #1282796).
      The BusID string created by prime-xconfig had several problems:
      1) It was missing the bus type "PCI", as recommended by
         xorg.conf(5).
      2) Values were written in hexadecimal, as reported by lspci,
         instead of decimal, as expected by the server. (See the
         comment at the top of xf86ParsePciBusString().)
      3) The PCI domain was not specified.
      Giving the BusID string in the wrong format could cause the X
      server to fail to parse the BusID, or to parse numbers in the
      wrong base. On systems with more than one PCI domain, `lspci -n`
      output would include the domain number, which is omitted by
      default on systems with only one PCI domain. nv_get_id()
      expects the bus number to be the first field, which would not be
      correct when `lspci -n` reports the domain, as it does on
      systems with multiple domains.
      Fix these issues by always reporting the domain with `lspci -Dn`
      and using it in the BusID string, prepending "PCI:" to the
      BusID string, and printing all numeric values in decimal.

nvidia-prime (0.5.5) trusty; urgency=low

  * debian/rules:
    - Fix path to lightdm configuration files.

nvidia-prime (0.5.4) trusty; urgency=low

  * Do not touch lightdm.conf any more on anything newer than Precise.
    90-nvidia.conf now contains only the relevant settings for PRIME
    (LP: #1267442).
  * Also remove any previous lightdm.conf that nvidia-prime might
    have messed up.
  * Major packaging clean-up. The variable in debian/rules and in
    templates have clearer names now.
  * Clean up the old 90-nvidia.conf that we used to ship in /etc.

nvidia-prime (0.5.3) trusty; urgency=low

  * debian/postrm.in, debian/rules:
    - Avoid calling dpkg-architecture (LP: #1264611).
  * prime-xconfig:
    - Properly format hexadecimal parameters (LP: #1252667).

nvidia-prime (0.5.2) trusty; urgency=low

  * debian/control:
    - Add an alternative dependency on gdm and kdm
      so that gdm or kdm users are not forced to install
      lightdm now that nvidia depends on nvidia-prime.
      This fixes only the single graphics card use case
      (hybrid graphics won't still work without lightdm)
      but it's a step in the right direction (LP: #1262068).
  * debian/preinst.in:
    - Set the lightdm configuration bits only if lightdm
      is the default display manager.

nvidia-prime (0.5.1) trusty; urgency=low

  * debian/nvidia-prime.upstart, prime-switch:
    - Send events to start and to stop the
      nvidia-persistenced upstart job.

nvidia-prime (0.5) trusty; urgency=low

  * debian/control:
    - Depend on bbswitch-dkms and upstart.
    - Depend on lightdm (>= 1.9.1).
    - Build only for i386 and amd64.
  * debian/install.in:
    - Install the new components.
  * debian/nvidia-prime.upstart:
    - Make sure that NVIDIA is always enabled on shutdown.
      This will avoid issues with the BIOS.
    - Make sure that bbswitch does not disable nvidia when
      loading.
    - Set up xorg.conf on boot.
  * debian/preinst.in:
    - Create a display-stopped-script entry in lightdm.conf.
    - Create /etc/lightdm/hybrid_default.
  * debian/postinst.in:
    - Remove it.
  * debian/postrm.in:
    - Remove /etc/lightdm/hybrid_default on package removal.
    - Remove the display-stopped-script entry from
      lightdm.conf.
    - Restore the non-prime related alternative on removal.
  * New upstream release:
    - Improved hardware detection. The package won't change
      anything if the hardware configuration is not
      supported. We only support laptops with NVIDIA
      optimus hardware and nvidia driver >= 319
      (LP: #1249067).
    - More robust system to deal with xorg.conf. Broken
      xorg.conf files will be automatically restored to
      a configuration that works with hybrid graphics.
      Whether on boot or on log out, we always try to make
      sure that the system is configured correctly.
    - Added prime-select switcher to switch between the
      integrated and the discrete GPU. This allows users
      to disable the discrete GPU to save power. Users'
      settings are now saved and applied on log out and
      on boot.
    - Added a quirk system to pass custom options to the
      bbswitch module (see /etc/prime-quirks).

nvidia-prime (0.4.2) trusty; urgency=low

  * debian/postinst.in: fix issue with printf
    - Apparently the printf command treats string values
      with leading zeros as octal. Work around this by
      removing any leading zeros (LP: #1219650).

nvidia-prime (0.4.1) trusty; urgency=low

  * debian/preinst.in:
    - Remove leftover in the test condition. This was
      causing the lightdm.conf file to be rewritten
      every time. This is a serious problem on the
      different Ubuntu flavours (LP: #1224098).

  * debian/postinst.in:
    - Do not touch the lightdm.conf (LP: #1199342).
  * debian/preinst.in:
    - Create a lightdm.conf if none can be found.

nvidia-prime (0.2) saucy; urgency=low

  * debian/control:
    - Conflict/replace/provide the hybrid-graphics virtual
      package.
  * Make sure to start X instead of XMir or hybrid graphics
    won't work, at least for now.
